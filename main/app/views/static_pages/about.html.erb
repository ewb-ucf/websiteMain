            EWB at the University of Central Florida
        </h2>
        <p class="about-ucf">
            The UCF chapter was founded in 2007 and began its first project 
            in Mare Brignol, Haiti in early 2008. EWB-UCF implemented a water 
            quality and supply project from 2009 to 2011. Students from the UCF 
            chapter implemented 34 bio-sand water filters and and a rain 
            catchement and water storage system in Mare Brignol. The project 
            formally concluded in 2013.
            <br><br>
            The UCF chapter currently has a local aquaponics project in 
            Bithlo, FL and is in the process of working with organizations in
            the Dominican Republic to start a new international project in the 
            region. Our project teams pursue several additional side projects
            ranging from automatic weather stations and software to local 
            rain catchment projects.

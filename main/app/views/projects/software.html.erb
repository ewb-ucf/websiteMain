            weather_station_description = 'The EWB-UCF Weather Station
            is an open source, infrastructure-independent data collection system
            designed to record and transmit weather data in real-time from 
            around the globe regardless in-country resources. The open source 
            design of the system allows other to replicate and improve upon the 
            weather station for their own purposes. 

            The weather station includes a web-based user interface and 
            engineering toolbox to analyze and apply weather data to real-world 
            development projects. The weather station uses a Raspberry Pi for 
            data collection and will communicate using the Iridium satellite 
            network upon completion. The open source software in implemented 
            using Python and the Django web framework.'

            ewb_website_description = 'Our software team also manages the 
            EWB-UCF website. Our site in implemented using Ruby on Rails to 
            allow for rapid development of new features. Various other languages
            and frameworks are used throughout the site, including HTML, CSS, 
            javacript, PHP, and Python. Many of our web projects use other 
            platforms. For example our Weather Station website uses the Python
            Django framework. This diversity of our site allows our developers
            to explore their interests and learn new skills while contributing
            to the EWB-UCF website.'

            coli_count_description = 'Our software team is working on a project 
            that utilizes image processing algorithms to detect and count 
            coliform and E. coli samples in a petri dish. This will allow 
            monitoring and assessment teams to simply take photos and send them
            back to EWB-UCF for immediate analysis rather than recording data 
            by hand and waiting to travel home to analyze the data. This faster
            data analysis could allow for more effective monitoring and 
            assessment trips while decreasing project costs.'
